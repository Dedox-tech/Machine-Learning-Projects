# Data Science Project by Diego Murillo

This is my Data Science and Machine Learning collection of projects. Since I am business-related undergraduate student, I am really interested in show how Machine Learning can solve real-world business problems very well.
The projects stored in this repository are ordered by industry or field. I am always learning Machine Learning for my own, so you can expect updates in the existing ones in a regular basis. Also I will add new projects as soon as I could.
